# AGENTS.md - Phase 0 Working Rules

## Project Goal
Build the smallest playable foundation for a long-horizon, policy-driven society simulation where systems unlock progressively (not preloaded).

## Repo Layout
- `index.html`, `style.css`: UI shell and styling
- `js/state.js`: initial world state
- `js/population.js`: demographic updates
- `js/economy.js`: grain economy + coupon issuance
- `js/unlocks.js`: generic prerequisite/unlock logic
- `js/policies.js`: policy definitions and effects
- `js/render.js`: UI rendering
- `js/game.js`: wiring, events, yearly loop
- `README.md`: project and phase documentation

## Phase 0 Scope
Only implement:
- Core agricultural state
- Year-by-year progression
- Policy prerequisites and unlock effects
- Bank -> clerks -> anti-counterfeit -> grain coupons chain
- Coupon stats/issuance only after unlock

## Architectural Rules
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS only (no framework, no backend)
- Keep modules small and composable
- Keep unlock logic generic and data-driven
- Run by opening `index.html` directly

## Important Do-Not Rules
Do not implement in Phase 0: migration, schools, hospitals, stock market, housing/villas, diplomacy, combat, maps, accounts, networking, cloud saves, or unrelated feature trees.

## Definition of Done (Phase 0)
- Year progression updates world and log
- Policy chain enforces prerequisites
- Grain coupons impossible before unlock
- Grain coupon UI appears only after unlock
- Required files are complete and non-placeholder
